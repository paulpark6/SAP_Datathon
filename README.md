# SAP_Datathon

# Challenge Overview
Leverage global sustainability and socioeconomic indicators to construct a Multidimensional Index that captures key aspects of poverty and development at the country level

The challenge focuses on identifying which factors contribute most to poverty, proposing
targeted policy recommendations, and uncovering key areas for improvement based on
data-driven insights. SAP’s commitment to global sustainability and equitable growth makes
this an exciting opportunity to develop innovative solutions that can drive real-world impact.

# Challenge Objectives
1. Build a Multidimensional Index:
○  Identify key indicators from the dataset that best capture different dimensions of
poverty, including education, health, and living standards.
○ Aggregate these indicators into a composite index to compare and rank
countries.
○ Explore relationships between sustainability efforts and poverty alleviation.
2. Determine the Most Influential Indicators:
○ Analyze which indicators contribute most significantly to poverty levels.
○ Utilize techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance methods,
or principal component analysis (PCA) to assess impact.

3. Develop Policy Recommendations:
○ Based on findings, propose data-driven policy interventions tailored to the top
N most affected countries.
○ Highlight areas for improvement and potential solutions that align with SAP’s
sustainability efforts.
