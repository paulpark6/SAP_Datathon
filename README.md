This is our github repo for our SAP Challenge. The ZIP file contains the submission requirements for the challenge. It includes the report, data visualizations (which are embedded in the report), and the code files. The code files are numbered, which reflect the order in which they should be looked at. Please reach out if there are any questions!

There was some confusion about the submission, what you see in the zip file contains the exact same files in the SAP Challenge folder.
